# SvelteKit Todo App

A clearly overkill framework for such a simple app, but I wanted to test out SvelteKit and some back end logic with PHP, SQL, and Docker.

## Roadmap

- [x] Scaffold UI
- [x] Create interactivity
- [ ] Submit form data to back-end
- [ ] Build server in PHP to catch request
- [ ] Submit data to MySQL
- [ ] Dockerize entire app
